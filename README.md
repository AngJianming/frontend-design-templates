# My-own-frontend-dev-design-template-libraries

This is meant to be a storage where I compile different types of design ranging from buttons, taskbars, navigation bars, animated backgrounds, futuristic gradiant coloring and other minor personal designs I made using **HTML5** & **CSS3** and maybe UI components or templates. Not only that, but I will also include preprocessors such as **SCSS** as well.
<br><br>
Do keep in mind that some designs will have no funcatinoalities as this repo will only be based of Frontend Designs, Animation & Effects.
